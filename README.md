# Vehicle-Detection
Here we have implemented improved Faster R-CNN model and evaluate their efficiency for vehicle detection using DAWN (Detection in Adverse Weather Nature)dataset
# DAWN Dataset
The DAWN (Dark, Adverse Weather Nighttime) dataset is a specialized dataset designed for evaluating object detection and segmentation algorithms under challenging conditions such as Fog, Rain, Sandstrom, Snowstorm scenarios. It includes images that are captured in environments with poor visibility due to low light, rain, fog, and other adverse weather conditions, making it particularly useful for testing the robustness of computer vision models used in autonomous driving and surveillance systems. The dataset typically contains annotations for various objects, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users, providing a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating models that need to operate reliably in these difficult conditions.
